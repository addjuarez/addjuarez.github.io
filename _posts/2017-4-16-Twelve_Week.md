title: Week Twelve!

**What did I do this past week?**
This week in class we went over class inheritance and how to make class handles and get a vector of object points to behave like it should behave. It was pretty enlightening since I just assumed vector would make it work but that was not the case. Outside of class I worked on the project with my partner. We made pretty decent progress but still have to finish the cell version.

**What's in my way?**
I am still not fully comfortable with abstract class and how pointers and vectors work so I need to go over the notes and probably mess around with them some more on my own time to see and test out how they work. I also need to finish this last project which I still think we have a lot to do. 
**What will I do next week?**
Next week Ill meet up with my partner some more and try to finish this project before Thursday if I can help it. I also should start preparing for the final test since I think it will be cumulative and remembering every detail we learned in class will take some time and pain for me.

**What's my experience of the class?**
Class is fine and enjoy working on the projects in pairs though hackerrank is not really group friendly in my opinion.

**Tip of the Week**
Spotifyâ€™s article on how they shuffle songs was an interesting read. <https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/>
