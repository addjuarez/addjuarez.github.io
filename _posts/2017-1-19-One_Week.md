title: Week One!

**What did I do this past week?**
I did not do much this week since it was the first week of classes and no assignments have been posted yet. I looked through the syllabus to see what books and software I needed just to get that out of the way. Most of the things I needed for this class I already had to use for software engineering so even then I did not do much.

**What's in my way?**
I am not familiar with C++ and still have much to learn about java from what I have seen in class. So, learning a new is language is the main issue but that is standard by now. I also need to get used to the three minute quizzes and to not take my time with them.

**What will I do next week?**
I will do the readings and perhaps try to learn some C++ on my own since we have no assignments yet. Though the assignment we probably be posted so I will work on that when that is done. I will also have to miss one class that week due to work so I will have to teach myself some of the material that I missed also.

**What's my experience of the class?**
So far, the class is similar to software engineering with Fraij. Though his class was based on Downingâ€™s software engineering class. So far, I enjoy the class and can tell it will be a tough class already. The daily quizzes are annoying in my opinion but they do make you pay attention in class.

**Tip of the Week**
I am using Jekyll for my blog since I used it for CS 373 and it worked pretty well. All I needed to do was fork the jekyll repo  and edit a few files and it was done.
