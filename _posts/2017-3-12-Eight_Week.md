title: Week Eight!

**What did I do this past week?**
This past we in class we mainly went over the new project and what we had to do and the expectations. It does not seem too hard from the looks of it but I havenâ€™t really looked at it yet so It may be harder than I think. The last day we had off since of spring break so not much happened this week.

**What's in my way?**
The project is the only thing in my way right now. The only thing I am concerned with is the time constraint since spring break is here and the project was released a little later than I though It would I will only have a few days to work on it with my partner. Though the project does not seem that hard and I did an allocator in C for my 439 class so It should be doable.

**What will I do next week?**
I will probably not do much in terms of this class since it is spring break and I plan on enjoying my last one but I will probably spent a little bit to look over the provided code so when my partner and I meet up I can just jump right in and not waste time.

**What's my experience of the class?**
Still liking the class as usual.

**Tip of the Week**
It found this interesting that the people running notepad++ released a hotfix to stop the CIA hacking it. <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html>
