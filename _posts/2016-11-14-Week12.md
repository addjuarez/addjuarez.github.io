title: Week twelve!

**What did I do this past week?** 
Last week was mainly spent trying to finish the project last week since it was tuesday. We didn't quite finish but we finished the important parts so it was not too bad. In class we went over some more sql queries, inserts and deletes. Most of them involved joins and subqueries with parts like in or not in. The last part of the week was spent looking at java code for a video store and showing us concepts like refactoring with it.


**What's in my way?** 
Right now there is not anything in my way. I still have a project I need to work on and finish this week. The api of the group we had to implement was not working for a few days so I had to wait a while to implement their api into our website so that was a bit of a blocker. The final test is also coming up so I have to start studying soon so I can do better than the last test.


**What will I do next week?** 
This week will as usual be spent finishing my part of the project and most likely picking up the slack of anything that did not get started or finished. Then maybe after the project is turned in ill start to review for a test a bit.




**Tip of The Week** 
I can not think of any more tips so here's a quote.
