title: Week Nine!

**What did I do this past week?** 
This week in class we spent going over the basics of xml and json. Earlier in the week we went over python code that mimic sql queries. Outside of class was spent working on our website project. For myself I mainly working on the frontend and help some of the backend. I wanted to work more on the backend but working on the frontend was much easier for me.

**What's in my way?** 
Trying to find time for everyone to meet up is challenging by itself. Most of my group is busy with other projects for classes or working. Documenting our project is something I need to get used too since I don't have to do it  often enough for it to be natural for me. 

**What will I do next week?** 
Next week will consist of more of the same as last week. Most of the time will be spent working on this project's next phase. Hopefully we can start earlier this time so we do not turn it in at the deadline due to some small things we left undone for a while. I also will try to improve our html a bit and make it more pleasant to the eye since it is too bare for me since I didn't have time to add some style to them.

**Tip of The Week** 
Since it is hackathon season It may be best to try and plan a schedule for projects so you do not have that group member that disappears suddenly for a hackathon.
