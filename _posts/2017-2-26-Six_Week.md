title: Week six!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
I spent this week mainly reviewing for this class in preparation for this test. I mainly went through the notes and stuff in the Github repo. In class we went over classes and structs in c++. How private and public work with classes, how constructors are done, and the difference between initialization and assignment.

**What's in my way?**
Currently the only thing in my way is the test. I know there is coding, short answer and multiple choice but that still does not give me much to go on. If the questions are like the quizzes I think I am fine but the coding part is the most troubling since I will probably make a syntax error here and there.

**What will I do next week?**
I will mainly do more serious studying and star making a note sheet for the test since the test is next week. Since he also  might also announce the project next week I may start looking into that as well.

**What's my experience of the class?**
This class is pretty well organized so far. We cover one topic and go I depth with it the whole day. The quizzes and chance that Iâ€™ll be called on keep me more awake than normal also so that is nice.

**Tip of the Week**
There is a program called webx that provides group calls sort of like skype which can be accessed by phone or computer. It also has screen sharing abilities which is useful for coding. I believe it is also free for small group calls as well.
