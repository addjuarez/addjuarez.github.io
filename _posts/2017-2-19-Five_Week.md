title: Week five!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
In class we learned about iterators and lambdas in c and how you can pass them as parameters for you functions. Then we learned about constant variables and pointers in the later part of the week. Outside of class I worked on finishing the voting project with my partner. It was not too bad though it did take some time to figure out how lists, vectors and maps work in c++ for the project.

**What's in my way?**
Since their is no project due for a few weeks there is not anything immediately in my way at the moment. Though the quizzes are still giving me trouble since the time limit makes me rush the questions a bit.

**What will I do next week?**
I will probably just start studying a bit for the upcoming test. I heard it was suppose to be quite hard so I guess I should start really early for a change. It is also the first test online I have to take so I am not sure what to expect.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class is teaching me a lot of small things that I did not consider about languages. It still kind of hard for me to remember all these things since I do not use c++ personally.

**Tip of the Week**
Jenkins is integration server tool similar to CI Travis except it has a free version you can use for yourself  and you do not need to be a student. Though you have to run the tests on your own computer or server instead of being provided a vm so that may be a turn off.
