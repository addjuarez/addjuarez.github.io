title: Week Two!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
In class we mainly went over the collatz project. We talked about all the requirements we would need to do like Travis and such. He also covered some ideas on how to implement an optimized collatzer with things like caches and bit shifting. Then we went over some C++ unit tests and learned about how do them. Out of class I mainly just began on the collatz project. I mainly just did the prep work like setting up Travis so Iâ€™ll have to do the optimizations later.

**What's in my way?**
Just getting used to C++ is my main issue. This project should make me learn the basics though. So finishing this project is the main obstacle this week.

**What will I do next week?**
This week will mainly be devoted to finishing collatz and probably going to the career fair. I have more luck with online applications than the science career fair but getting some practice with interviewing and giving a first impression will not hurt.

**What's my experience of the class?**
So far I am liking the class. I am starting to like the constant calling out people in the class to answer questions since it makes me stay involved in the class. Also the weekly attempts to get us to talk to one another with quick group discussions are nice as well.

**Tip of the Week**
Cygwin is a neat collection of tools that can give you a terminal similar to those on a Linux system.
