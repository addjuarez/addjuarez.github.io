title: Week four!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
Last week we went over pointer and references again since part of the class still had trouble with them. Then we went over arrays and linked list and how pointers work with them. Finally we went over iterators and how to make functions more flexible with their parameters types by using templates. I also found myself a partner and started on the voting project. 

**What's in my way?**
Right now the c++ voting project in the main thing on my plate right now. It is much more involved since we have to start from scratch and it requires more than a few loops and arrays to solve this it this time.

**What will I do next week?**
Next week my partner and I have to finish the project and we still have a lot of work to do. The career fair is also this week so both us will probably will be really bust this week. I need to some resume checking and some background research on the companies this week as well before the fair.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The still like the class so far. It really helps that you are sort of forced into participating or to pay attention in class since he will call on you and will get some sort of answer out of you. The little exercises are also helpful as well.
**Tip of the Week**
Spoj.com I a website similar to hackerrank with coding challenges with constraints like speed and size.
