title: Week Two!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
For the Second week of software engineering I mainly worked on Collatz. Optimizing it to pass sphere took more than I thought and learning all the new tools is what took up most of my time in this class. In class Fraijs went over some concepts with Python programming. He went of types and subclass and how they work in python and how errors are used.

**What's in my way?**
I am still getting a grasp on the python language and learning the python tools like pydoc and troubleshooting them takes a bit of time for me. The Collatz was a bit trickery than I thought it would be since it was easy to overlook some things and my understanding of python is still of a beginner.

**What will I do next week?**
I will put the finishing touches on the Collatz project and try to learn python a bit more on my own as well as in class. I will also start preparing for the next project since there is most likely software we will use that I am not experienced in yet.

I feel as that I am learning a lot about python as I did not know much about it before and on how to test and debug my code by working on Collatz. I never put my emphasis on optimization but know I am more inclined to keep it in my priorities. 

**Tip of the Week**
Most of what the professor teaches is usable and relevant for the projects.
