title: Week Six!

**What did I do this past week?** 
This week I mainly studied some in preparations for the midterm this week. The test is mainly over python programming so I mainly studied it library functions and concepts. In class we mainly talk about function defaulting and function unpacking. That mainly involved tuples and dictionaries being unpack or pack when declared as the argument or result. We then went over range iterables. 

**What's in my way?** 
I am not sure how hard this midterm will be so that is kind of in my way right now. This is his first time teaching so I have no references for this class. I am also still new to the language so I hope I will manage to get past this exam.  The next project is also coming up soon so I should prepare for that as well.

**What will I do next week?** 
I will continue studying and preparing for this exam since that is the only assignment we have currently and I do not know anything about what the next project will be . After the test we have a small break so I will also be enjoying that until the project gets released.

**Tip of The Week** 

Since this is midterm season and cs projects are also getting harder it becomes really important that you manage your time and try not to get to stressed. With all the interviews, projects and midterms going on having some time time to relax is also important.
