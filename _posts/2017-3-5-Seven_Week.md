title: Week seven!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
Last Week in class we went over more class business for c++. We went over creating class methods and writing operators for the class such as =, * and ++. Also, went to one of the talks Downings promoted for Mutual Mobile. Outside of class I mainly studied the notes and exercises to prepare for the quiz on Thursday.

**What's in my way?**
Currently nothing is in my way since the test is over with and no project is currently assigned. Also, spring break is next week so not much seems to be happening right now.

**What will I do next week?**
The next project will probably be assigned so I will probably start looking into that and searching for a partner for the project as well. Not sure how much I will get done though since I really prefer to not work on the project much over spring break.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class is still teaching me a lot. The test was sort of what I expected. Though a certain topic came up on the test more than I thought it would so that part was harder to get through compared to the other sections.

**Tip of the Week**
Udacity has some useful free classes for programming and is ran by google. They any class from android to java. I used them for more of an introduction into things like mobile applications since those are the free ones.
