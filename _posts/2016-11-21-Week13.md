**What did I do this past week?** 
Last week was spent working on and finishing the final phase of the database website project. I mainly was working on the external api integration for our website. In class we went over the store java code some more which showed various coding changes like refactoring to make the code more efficient and more clean. We also went over java function overriding and subclass functions. 


**What's in my way?** 
Right now the only thing in my way would be doing the presentations which personally dislike but it are not that bad when you have a group with you. Since we have a large group of 5 the presentation won't be all that bad though making it last 10 minutes is something I  do not know how are going to accomplish exactly. The main thing I need to worry about is the test since we have gone over java, sql and xml in addition to python this test might be a bit tricker than the last test so I will have to take it more seriously this time If I want a decent grade in it.


**What will I do next week?** 
I will probably do a little bit of review for the test but since it is thanksgiving break and our presentation is mostly finished I think It will be a week which I do not get much stuff since I taking advantage of this break.


**Tip of The Week**

Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but, when we look back everything's different.
