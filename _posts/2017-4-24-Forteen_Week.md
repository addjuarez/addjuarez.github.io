title: Week Forteen!

**What did I do this past week?**
Last week we went over handles like we did with the last project with abstract pointers to abstract base classes. Outside of class I did a little review for the upcoming test.

**What's in my way?**
Nothing is in my way except for the final test. I feel have to have a solid understanding of most if not all of the material if I want to get a good grade since downing multiple choice answers for his questions tend to have all possible options so it is hard to just guess the right answer especially since the questions sometimes have more than 5 choices to choose from.

**What will I do next week?**
I will just study and review the past notes and quizzes to prepare for the test like I did last time. I have tests for all my other classes this week as well so I do not think I will have much time so study which means my grade for this test will be pretty meh. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
I really enjoyed the class. I like downing’s sense of humor and the way he leads to answer his questions in class wrong. I also can come to class more relaxed now that I don’t have a timed quiz waiting for me every other day.

**Tip of the Week**
I now know why ssh uses port 22 and it is not for the reasons I thought it was. <https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port>
