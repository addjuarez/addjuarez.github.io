title: Week Three!
---

**What did I do this past week?** 
For third week I finished the collatz project which required some unforeseen last minute tweaks.  
In class we went over some optimizations in python and various behaviors involving operators and how they act with sets, list and tuples.

**What's in my way?** 
The next project at first glance seems like it will be tough since there was a million-dollar prize for the solution after all. It is due next week so I should get started as soon as I can so I don’t have to work against the deadline. I still need to learn more about how python handles its pointers and interacts with different objects when the same operations are applied to them.

**What will I do next week?** 
I will start working on the Netflix project and also hopefully find a partner to work through it with. Fraij will probably give us some hints or a starting point for this project so I will take notes and go from there as far as the project goes.

**Tip of The Week** 
with The career fair coming up you should not be afraid to get rejected. You will for the most part never see that recruiter again and there are hundreds of more companies out there. Just like your code it will give bad results occasionally.
There is also a Linux like terminal for windows called Cygwin that’s pretty useful if you’re like me and know more Linux commands than windows command line
