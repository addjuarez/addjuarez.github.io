**What did I do this past week?**

This past week mainly involved me looking over the Netflix project and brainstorming some ideas and looking for a partner to join in in this project. I also reviewed the material we learned in class which was more of what does this piece of python code do. This week it was mainly over iteration. We also had a guess speaker who was a developer at Bloomberg talk about his company and what he does. He gave some insight on recruiting and what to expect when working.

**What's in my way?**

I haven’t made much progress with the Netflix project since my partner’s schedules conflicted with mine this past week but even with a late start I am sure we can manage to finish this project. I also need to review the notes from class since there are still a few examples I cannot quite follow from class.

**What will I do next week?** 

I will start to work towards starting and finishing the Netflix project with my partner. I will also need to review some of the code we have gone through class before I forget why the code behaves the way it does. Also I plan to attend the career fair and the professor has been encouraging us to attend this heavily.

**Tip of The Week** 

Jenkins is a neat open source server automation tool that isn’t too difficult to set up and can let you experiment with automation and scripts if your new.
