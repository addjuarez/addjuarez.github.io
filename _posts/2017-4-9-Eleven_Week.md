title: Week Eleven!

**What did I do this past week?**
Most of my time was spent working on the project Darwin with my partner. It took us longer than I thought it would and I though we started kind of early as well. We ended up finishing it last minute so I should prepare more for the next project. In class we talked more about vectors and went over move assignments and move constructors which I never heard of before so it was interesting.

**What's in my way?**
The last project was harder than I thought so I need to get better at object oriented programming or maybe just plan out the project more instead of just going into and coding immediately.  I would like to not have to be on crunch time and working on the day it was do this time so I will try to get serious early on this time.

**What will I do next week?**
Next week I will start looking for a partner for the last project and will try to start early since this project looks like a lot of work. Also maybe start thinking about looking over the past notes for the test thatâ€™s slowly coming up.

**What's my experience of the class?**
Class is still a very good class. I would take another class with downing if I had another year.

**Tip of the Week**
I did not know C++ 17 was being worked on and will come out eventually.
