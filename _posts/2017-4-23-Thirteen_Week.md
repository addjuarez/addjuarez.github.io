title: Week Thirteen!

**What did I do this past week?**
Last week in class we went over abstract classes and virtual methods on C++ and Java. We talked about the similarities and the differences between how they both behave in the languages. Outside of class I spent most of my time working on the Life project with my partner. It was a lot harder than I thought trying to get the clone methods to work and trying to manage memory was a real pain.

**What's in my way?**
Since there are no more projects left the only thing that can get in my way is the final exam which I think is going to be pretty hard to remember every little detail throughout the semester so I can get past the code reading part will be a challenge.

**What will I do next week?**
Next week I will be probably just start preparing for the final test. I will probably just do what I did last time and go over all the notes and examples then try the quizzes to see how I am doing. I also need to remember to go over L and R values since that surprised me a bit on the first test.

**What's my experience of the class?**
Class is fine. I feel I have an okay understanding of C++ thanks to this class. Since most of my main languages are java and python I am glad I took the class. 

**Tip of the Week**
This articles on NASAâ€™s coding rules was a cool read.. <http://www.rankred.com/nasa-coding-rules/>
