title: Week Eleven!
---


**What did I do this past week?** 
This week in class we studied sql queries and how various constraints and joins interact with each other with concepts like using, right joins, left joins and natural joins. Earlier in the week we also went over regex in python and did some examples in class. Outside of class I spent most of my time working on the project that was due last week. My part was mostly designing the front end and helping with the backend such as the unit tests when I could. 


**What's in my way?** 
I am slowly getting more comfortable with html and css but I still need more experience with javascript since I still have not quite grasped it. Also finding time to work together on this project is still proving a challenge and I would have liked to have spent more time on this project but that did not happen. I will try to start earlier but tests are coming up so we will see.


**What will I do next week?** 
The next project comes out this week so I will start working on that. I will probably try to fix any things that we missed on the website and see if I can improve it in any small ways like design or implementations of any of the past features we added. I will also be working on the presentation since that is probably a big part of the grade as well. Plus I want a break from web development since html is tedious for me.


**Tip of The Week** 
Use printouts if you can't debug it with logic - novak
