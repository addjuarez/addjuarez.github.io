**What did I do this past week?**
In class we mainly went over arrays and classes some more and how arrays differ from built in types and user types. Later in class we started to build a vector class and talk about what it would need and hwo it would work. Out of class worked the allocator project with my partner.

**What's in my way?**
Nothing is in my way at the moment. The next project got assigned so I need to go find a partner and start working on that. I did something like that in java for 301 though I am sure this will be a bit harder. I also need to get more comfortable with classes and learn when to use constant with them.

**What will I do next week?**
This week I will try to find a partner a soon as I can. I also will try to start the project so I will not have to rush next week. Though most of time will be spent on other classes since I have a lot going on with them this week. I will also try to attend the new talk downing advertised on piazza to get some more quiz points.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I am still learning a lot in this class. I am also starting appreciate hackerrank more.

**Tip of the Week** 
I do not have any tips this week so here is a comic you might have seen before <https://xkcd.com/378/>
