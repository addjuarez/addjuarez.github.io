title: Week Eight!
---

**What did I do this past week?** 
I have been mainly working on the project the was released last week. I am on the backend team for this phase so I have been getting the models started. Getting the flask and website started was also a bit tedious even with the whole group present since most of us are new to web development.

**What's in my way?** 
I have a small amount of experience in web development so this will be a challenge for to learn. I am also new to alot of this software like SQLalchemy and flask. So i have a lot to learn and do and not much time to complete all of it since we have about a week and a half to finish this phase. Work from other classes has also been eating up my time so time management is starting to become tough to find the time.

**What will I do next week?** 
I will finish the backend and the report this week one way or another than start to plan for the next phase with my group. We will probably switch roles so I will have to review frontend concepts a bit

**Tip of The Week** 

Webex is a useful tool for meeting remotely kind of like skype. It has voice, webcam support and can be accessed through phone. It also gives you the ability to share screens so it is useful for programming in groups. It is also free for small sessions with 3 or less people.
