title: Week Fourteen!
---

**What did I do this past week?** 
The past week I did not do much on my own in in class. In class we just finished going over coding pratices with the java store example. We went over things like refactoring or design patterns like factory methods. Last week was also thanksgiving break so I spent most of my time away from school and homework. I reviewed for the test a bit but I still need to prepare much more for the test.

**What's in my way?** 
The only thing thats left for me to do is to prepare for the presentation and finally do the presentation. We have not really prepared for it much so I hope it goes well one way or another. I also have the final test for the class to worry about so I'll have to prepare for that so I do not do as bad as the first exam. The test is over quite a few different languages and schemas so It will take some memorization.

**What will I do next week?** 
Study and preare for the test since that is the last grade we have for this class. And I will be doing the presentation for our group. More time we be spent on test review though since presentations are pretty straight forward especially if they are demos for projects.
