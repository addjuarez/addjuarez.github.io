title: Week One!

**What did I do this past week?**
For the first week of Frajiâ€™s class we talked about syllabus and house keeping things for the first part of the class. We then talked a bit about python programming and went over some things we would need for the project. The last part of the class was talking about the first project collatz. We would have to implement an efficient collatz program the used caching. He also talked about some software like sphere and Travis to test our project.

**What's in my way?**
I am not very experienced with python so there will be a learning curve and I will need to learn how to use this new software we are being introduced too. I took more time than I thought to set up the project and additional things like Travis.

**What will I do next week?**
I will work on and try to finish the collatz project this week so I will have time to go to office hours It turns out I need assitance. I will also try to take a crash course in python this week to make things easier.

This class seems like it will be useful in replicating the software development experience in the real world. Getting more experience with github, unit testing and python is something I could use more off. This class seems like it will be challenging but I hoping to learn a lot from the hours I will spend on this class.

**Tip of the Week**
Just like what the professor said start as early as possible.
