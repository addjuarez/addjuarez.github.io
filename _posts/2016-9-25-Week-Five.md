**What did I do this past week?**

This past week was mainly spent working on the netflix project with my partner. Setting up the caches and functions to do the groundwork for the program took the most time. The actual algorithm did not take too much time since we had caches from the other students and that saved a lot of time. In class we went over generator functions and yields and had a speaker from nasa talk about virtual reality projects he was working on. 

**What's in my way?**

Preparing for the midterm is the only thing in my way right now and other than python code reading I have no real Idea what is gonna be on this test. So I will have to see if I can learn more about what to expect on this test.

**What will I do next week?** 

This week my focus we just be reviewing and preparing for the midterm since we do not have a project to work on until after the midterm has passed. So reviewing the class notes and the python code pieces is what y time for this class will mainly be spent on. I may also review the readings again since I do not know what to watch out for.

**Tip of The Week** 

Work on projects with a partner if you have the option at school or at work. You will usually learn something by working with them or at least have them correct some small mistakes you will make and not notice.
