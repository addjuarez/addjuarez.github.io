title: Week three!
---

**What did I do this past week?**
This past week we went over exceptions in C++ and the best practices on how to use them. We also had Bloomberg come to our class and give a presentation about their company. They mainly told us what they do and how it is to work there as a new hire a such. No free stuff sadly. The last day in class we went over pointers references in C++ which was a little complicated for me at first. Out of class I spent finishing the collatz project. It was not too bad though since I had to the project in python but hackerrank tests were harder than the site we used.

**What's in my way?**
Nothings is in my way at the moment but there is the next Australian project to look out for and start on.

**What will I do next week?**
Next week will be preparing on going to the career fair and working on the new project. I also need to find a partner as well.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I am still enjoying the class. The project are tedious with all the extra work you have to do besides the main problem but some of it is stuff you do in the real world so It does make sense to do it.

**Tip of the Week**
LeetCode is nice website to get some interview practice with some small coding challenges
