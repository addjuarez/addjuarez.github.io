title: Week Seven!

**What did I do this past week?** 
This week we went over ranges and decorators in python in the first half of the week. The other half of the week was spent taking the midterm. The midterm was what I had expected but I should have prepared more for it. I will have to do better on the final since I do not not think I did too well on this first midterm.

**What's in my way?** 
The test did not go as planned so I will have to be better prepared for the next test and put more time and effort into studying. I still need more experience in python so some small programming exercises might be need for me to sufficient in this language. I am also lacking in web development experience so this project will be a bit of a learning experience for me.

**What will I do next week?** 
Now that the exam is out of the way I will need to start on this project. I will have to first find a group of 5 people to work with. Then hopefully start working on the project this week. I will probably need to do some research on web development since my experience with it is limited to simple static websites.

**Tip of The Week** 

Reddit has a few useful subreddits for programming such as  /r/learnprogramming and /r/programming/ if stackoverflow somehow does not have the answer to your problem.
