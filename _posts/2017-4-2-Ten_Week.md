title: Week Ten!

**What did I do this past week?**
Last week in class we talk about the project and what it was and what we should do for it. Later in the week we went over vectors and went over how they were implemented. Outside of class I found a partner and started working on the project.

**What's in my way?**
The project is in my way at the moment. At first it seemed like a straightforward project but not being able to use setters and getters is harder than I thought. Keeping the variables private from other classes is harder as well. I need more experience with not using setter and getters. Java has spoiled me or I never really questioned why I used getters and setters.

**What will I do next week?**
Next week I will work in the project some more with my partner and try to figure out how to design this project some more. Also probably start looking for a partner for project 5 if it is assigned this week and maybe start working on it early since it is the last project so It most likely will be a pain..

**What's my experience of the class?**
I am enjoying the projects as much as one can enjoy school projects and I am learning from them instead of just doing something really hard. Still bad at quizzes though.

**Tip of the Week**
This article about keeping servers and clients in games was interesting. <http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/how-does-multiplayer-game-sync-their-state-part-1>
