**What did I do this past week?** 
The past week in class we did not do much in class. The week we had two companies come out and talk to us about their company, what it's like to work their and career advice. The two companies were spiceworks and another company I don't remember the name of but they had a dolphin as their mascot and did software consulting. The people from the company were mostly UT alumni which was cool.


**What's in my way?** 
Having to finish the project is the main thing in way this week just like last week. I don't really like web development much but the skills and software are still good to learn. Hopefully we can finish in time since everybody was busy last week or at least I hope they were. Finding time to work together is also been a big challenge for this project since everyone seems to be busy and different times which makes it worse.


**What will I do next week?** 
This week will mostly be me trying to finish the project which will mainly for me be learning javascript and dynamic web page design since I only have made static web pages before. Hopefully I can learn quickly since the due date is coming up soon. 


**Tip of The Week** 
Connections are the most important thing when looking for internships and jobs is what my marketing professors says every class.
